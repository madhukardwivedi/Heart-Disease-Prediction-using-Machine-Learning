In this project, I will take you through how to train a model for the task of heart disease prediction using Machine Learning.
 
I have used different classification algorithms in machine learning to train a model to predict heart disease.

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. 
This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, 
predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)

Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)

Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)

K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)

Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)

Random Forest (Scikit-learn)

XGBoost (Scikit-learn)

**The best accuracy was given by Random Forest i.e. 91.8 %.**
